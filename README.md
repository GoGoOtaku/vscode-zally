# Zally OpenAPI Linter

OpenAPI linter based on rules by Zalando.

## Setup

**This extension does not implement a Zally server!**  

Check out the official website how to setup your own server.  
http://opensource.zalando.com/zally/

This extension talks directly to the server so neither the CLI nor the WebUI are required.

The server URL can be set via the configuration.

## Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with Zalando or Zally.
I just didn't want to copy paste my API definition into the Web-UI anymore.
